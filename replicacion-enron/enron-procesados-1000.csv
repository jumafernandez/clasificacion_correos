1,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

24,"Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  A single buyer entered the 
marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices 
($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the 
time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 
cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to 
report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of 
line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Phillip

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

August 28th.  I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I 
will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can 
treat the 2nd as payment for October.

 I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without 
getting the details and getting your approval.

 I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.

Here are my questions on the August bank statement (attached):

1.  Check 1406  Walmart    Description and unit?

 You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood. 

  I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which  
I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering 
properties or contacts?  Is your position based on a legal or what you 
perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a 
project from scratch?

 I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

   

 Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we 
need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the ""Checkbook"" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?

Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?

 I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think 
I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.

I was glad to hear from you.  I hope we can put the past behind us.  Sounds 
like you have been busy.  Congratulations on the new baby.  Judging from your 
email all is well with you.   That's great.  

We did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace).  Three is it for us.  
What's your target?  The other two are doing well.  Soccer, T-ball, and bike 
riding keeps them busy.  They could use some of Cole's coordination.

My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now.  I am just on 
maintenance.  You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical 
cyclist.  We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months.  
He never misses, rain or shine.  Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial 
Park on Saturdays.   Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the 
road.  I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday.

I would like to hear more about your new job.  Maybe we could grab lunch 
sometime.

If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.  I can spread it over 6

Use Page Setup under the File menu to change  from Portrait to Landscape if 
you want to change from printing vertically 
to printing horizontally.  Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want 
your print out to be on only one page.  Use Print preview
to see what your print out will look like before you print.

The truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles.  A valve 
adjustment might do some good.  It has idled very high
for the last 25,000 miles, but it has never broken down.

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

286,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and 
jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our 
Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its 
forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been 
lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the 
second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The 
outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some 
additional insight?

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general

the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within 
his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe 
he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from

please email them to me as well?

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current 
summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 
existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above 
assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email 
with comments.

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 
41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story

front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially 
set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever 
the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very 
short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not 
match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic 
about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels 
into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

Call Ted Bland about the trading track program.  All the desks are trying to 
use this program to train analysts to be traders.  Your experience should 
help you in the process and make the risk rotation unnecessary. Unless you 
are dying to do another rotation is risk.

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on 
Friday, April 13th.  However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned 
I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get 
back in touch with you once he is finished.

Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager 
from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable 
with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp 
Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid 
for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am 
still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local 
relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final 
determination on unit mix and site plan.

The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit ""B"" are as follows:

Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 
is outstanding.

Kohutek- $2,150 

Cuatro- $37,800


George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this 
amount.

The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 
appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    I couldn't find any reference to this 
cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.

Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the

I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.

Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?

What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 
221(d) loans?  

Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market 
quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:

  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment
  2%- overhead
  4%- profit

I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an 
extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even 
reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only 
generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about 
such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down 
to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?

I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you 
local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of 
the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a 
list of questions on the specs:

1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less 
and cost about the same?

2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory 
joist?

3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?

4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What 
type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or 
Cellulose?

5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?

6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know 
the difference between an apron and a stool.

7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent 
cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?

8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial 
one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.

9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under 
the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.

10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount 
stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.

11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.

12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?

13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?

14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron 
railings?

15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except 
for change orders?

I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but 
this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to 
call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the 
engineer.
I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership.  

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

Let me know what you think.

Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:

Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf 
(rentable)

What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?

Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2% 
overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.

Why is profit only 4%? 

Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.

What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to 
boost loan amount but not a real cost?

Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who 
receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?

Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?

What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts 
NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% 
expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage 
would only be 1.16.

Talk to you this afternoon.

Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of

 Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.

 Specific features include:

 Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs
 Wood stairs
 Two story porches on front and rear
 Granite counters in kitchens and baths
 Tile floors in upstairs baths
 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths
 Solid wood interior doors
 Windows fully trimmed
 Crown molding in downstairs living areas
 2x6 wall on west side

 Undecided items include:

 Vinyl or Aluminum windows
 Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room
 Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 
sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a 
box with a simple roof

Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to 
replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than 
the full replatting process of 3 weeks?

Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the 
plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes 
across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for 
the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.

The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might 
object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the 
construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs 
of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the 
loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of 
equity that would be required. 

Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.

Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, 
engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are 
in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking 
directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on 
what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  

The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we 
need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and 
give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.

I realize you are disappointed about the project.  It is not my desire for 
you to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your list 
that I need further

was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash 
investment in the land.  I agree that you should be refunded any cash 
investment.  My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

388,"Gentlemen,

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is 
still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.  

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.  

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

George finally sent me some information.  Please look over his email.  He 
wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.  

We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to 
determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect 
work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation 
for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were 
proposing was unsupportable by the market.  

My version of a buyout is attached.

I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to 
foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  
Since their cost
and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I 
wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I 
want to respond to their offer asap.

Call me with your thoughts.

I didn't receive the information on work completed or started.  Please send 
it this morning.  

We haven't discussed how to proceed with the land.  The easiest treatment 
would be just to deed it to us.  However, it might be more
advantageous to convey the partnership.

Also, I would like to speak to Hugo today.  I didn't find a Quattro 
Engineering in Buda.  Can you put me in contact with him.

Talk to you later.

Here is a rentroll for this week.  

What is the outstanding balance on #1.  It looks like 190 + 110(this week)= 
300.  I don't think we should make him pay late fees if can't communicate 
clearly.

#2 still owe deposit?

#9  What day will she pay and is she going to pay monthly or biweekly.

Have a good weekend.  I will talk to you next week.

In about two weeks we should know for sure if these buyers are going to buy 
the property.  I will keep you informed.

398,"Darrell,

Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his 
excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the 
land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like 
to proceed and develop the property. 

 My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would 
also like to compare construction and development services between what you 
can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.  
Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to 
be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural 
work to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is 
Quattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion about 
either.

I look forward to working with you.  Talk to you tomorrow.

406,"George,

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have
the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our
project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my
concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around
$10.5 million.  The components are as follows:

     Unit Cost, Site work, &
     builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million

     Land                      1.15

     Interim Financing               .85

     Common Areas                     .80

     Total                         $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable
to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can
produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for
location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize
that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates
that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not
believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8
million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that
we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5
million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to 
discuss
alternatives.

Phillip

Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:

#2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is 
not on any rentroll that I can see.

#9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she 
will start paying on #9

#15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to 
collect the $95 in question.

#33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?

#26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  
Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.

#44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of 
the year.

#33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't 
see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to 
figure these out immediately.

I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll 
in case you need to research these questions.

I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be

Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies 
forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.

Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:

1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, 
TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the 
       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and 
TAGG but the issues facing 
       scheduling in Unify are grey.

2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" 
policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need 
further      scrutiny.

3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical 
imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?

4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training 
courses, review progress and make cuts.

5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at 
everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add 
   some value and direction to the group.


In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD

435,"Jaques,

After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different 
definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a 
superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third 
party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" 
fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be 
paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally 
the builders profit of 1.4 million.

Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out 
of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if 
they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  
We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition 
to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been 
in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and 
the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management 
fee is included.

George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will 
review and let you know what I think.

The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to 
the 3 out 4 approval process.

Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only 
true costs + 1.4 million.

Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject 
to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.

It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there 
unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.

When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize 
that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.  

Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes 
if you need to.





Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and 
refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form 
to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this 
information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to.

It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office.  Please have my Dad call me with

Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.



There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.

1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank 
is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the 
spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.

2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?

3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?

4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?

5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?

6.  #14  missed on 2/2?

7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?

8.  #20a missed on 2/2?

9.  #35 missed on 2/2?

My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  
You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on 
some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the 
bank deposit.

Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade

Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?  

The key business points are:

1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate

2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million

3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.

4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?

5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I 
would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.

Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.

My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a 
sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only 
require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I 
would net around $20K cash.  

You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or 
higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the 
New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.

I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 
years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several 
reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the 
large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer 
are the three biggest concerns.  

What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the 
buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due 
until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the 
property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make 
the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance 
is pushing too far.

Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the 
earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?

Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New 
Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get 
started on the list.

Email or call  me later today.

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The 
other questions I had about last week's rent are:

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

Phillip

The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted 
to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could 
not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more 
towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One 
wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 
kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + 
guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This 
plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the 
courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor 
living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 
 The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass 
skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have 
single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  

I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would 
like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I 
would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I 
would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we 
didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. 

Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.

Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.

1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and 
repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor 
cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on 
repairs.

2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite 
manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has 
interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager 
that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a 
management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager 
onsite.

3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you 
want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.

4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure 
this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.

My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property 
definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.


Sales Price  705,000

1st Lien   473,500

2nd Lien  225,000

Transfer fee    7,500

Cash required   14,500


NOI   100,000

1st Lien    47,292

2nd Lien   23,694

Cash flow  29,014

Cash on cash  200%


These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then 
cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the 
additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years 
for a higher price.

Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.

That is good news about Leander.  

Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have 
about $225K invested in the stagecoach, 
 it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.  

I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee 
and Jaques Craig can 
work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a 
second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.
Checkout this spreadsheet.





These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.   
However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy 
show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some 
trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the 
time and I don't trust 
Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from 
now on.  

I will have the operating statements complete through December by this 
Friday.

#32 and #29 are fine.  

#28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid 
260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He 
either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the 
middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number. 

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the 
forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a 
supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 

""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, 
a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" 

But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas 
Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the 
storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the 
numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than 
reality. 

""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what 
we are reporting,"" McGill said. 

As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- 
and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing 
fingers at Wall Street. 

Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently 
stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for 
the rise in gas prices. 

""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik 
told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 

In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric 
utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 

Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame 
for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their 
customers and constituents from such price spikes. 

Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take 
precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price 
insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas 
prices before they soared. 

""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul 
Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 

But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 

""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to 
change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security 
Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 


Hot topic 

Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In 
many circles, little else is discussed. 

The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is 
facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the 
previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as 
well. 

The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of 
his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial 
pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 

""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. 

A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per 
thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile 
to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by 
customers. 

But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand 
cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage 
for winter. 

There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, 
prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information 
Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating 
bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 

But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, 
including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas 
markets. 

""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 

Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York 
traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile 
commodity in the world. 


Setting the price 

In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of 
gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading 
contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had 
widespread influence over gas prices. 

The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon 
as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale 
prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from 
utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what 
they pay for the gas they expect to use. 

There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention 
of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge 
of natural gas. 

But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to 
know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all 
futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to 
their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money 
in a short time. 

As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less 
than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's 
weekly storage numbers. 

Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to 
need in the winter. 

Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than 
average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in 
hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 

Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be 
sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the 
concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 

Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage 
numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the 
association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 

But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice 
president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had 
continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 

""I was getting worried,"" he said. 

Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices 
dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 


Just passing through 

Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but 
pass their fuel costs on to customers. 

Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas 
charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas 
Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 

Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last 
month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could 
be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve 
energy. 

Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to 
save an average customer about $25 this winter. 

Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an 
extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not 
guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 

Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left 
customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether 
they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel 
costs. 

On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public 
Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to 
perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 

""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider 
some changes.""

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There 
are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all 
the cold weather.

You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.  
This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.

I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We 
also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need 
to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write 
something today.



Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start 
collecting.

 There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other 
for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13?

 Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For 
what periods?

 
What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!  
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money 
and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first 
asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like 
leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the 
apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly 
inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has 
been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so 
I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this

 I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I 
described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in 
San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a 
couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like 
to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not 
require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to 
structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has 
been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the 
equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this 
nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to 
permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be 
important to banks. 

 I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer 
email or fax his financial statement to you.

connections?  Other rezoning costs?  

What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I 
owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this 
property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes 
once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him 
grazing rights?

What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and 
annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and 
American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we 
are pushing the process as fast as we can.

I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.

 Here is a rentroll for this week.  The one you sent for 11/24 looked good.  
It seems like most people are paying on time.  Did you rent an efficiency to 
the elderly woman on a fixed income?  Go ahead a use your judgement on the 
rent prices for the vacant units.  If you need to lower the rent by $10 or 
$20 to get things full, go ahead.

 I will be out of the office on Thursday.  I will talk to you on Friday.

 I want to get the lease data and tenant data updated.  
  
  The critical information is  1.  Move in or lease start date
      2.  Lease expiration date
      3.  Rent
      4.  Deposit 
  
  If you have the info you can
  fill in these items  1.  Number of occupants
      2.  Workplace
      

  All the new leases should be the long form.



 The apartments that have new tenants since these columns have been updated 
back in October are  #3,5,9,11,12,17,21,22,23,25,28,33,38.
  

 I really need to get this by tomorrow.  Please use the rentroll_1215 file to 
input the correct information on all these tenants.  And email it to me 
tomorrow.  You should have all this information on their leases and 
applications.

 #11  Looks like she is caught up.  When is she due again?

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars 
that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped 
from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

Let me know if you disagree.

 The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other 
investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background 
information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.

 Background Questions:
 
 Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in 
Creekside.

 Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project 
description, investors, business entity, 

 Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.

 Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on 
recent projects.


 With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple 
of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the 
investors. 


 Preferable Investment Structure:

 Developers guarantee note, not investors.

 Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.

 Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.

         Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should 
tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in 
any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that 
leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any 
information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

 Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy 
Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment 
to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM 
to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.  
If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this 
time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.  
She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.

 Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. 
specialist.  Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.  Let me know 
what is an acceptable cash amount.

 Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her 
efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the 
gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling 
group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Patti 
was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she 
would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the 
traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information 
has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size 
of the west desk positions.  
 Please call to discuss cash award.

Western Power Prices Fall With Warmer Weather, Natural Gas Loss

     Los Angeles, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Western spot
power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather
across the region and declining natural gas prices.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest
temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.
     At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell
$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.
     ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were
supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the
weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.""
     Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,
and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.
     Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the
El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.
     ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices
to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased
$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell
to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.
     PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant
was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled
to restart this weekend.
     At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at
$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.

PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas

     Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day
power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and
falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western
PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades
ranging from $62.00-$76.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures
could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.
     ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of
the morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expiration
the market had pretty much dried up.""
     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main
reason for the decline in spot market prices.
     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the
New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million
British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since
Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of
$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts
indicated reduced utility load requirements.
     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they
normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather
forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.
     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13
higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the
$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-
$92.00.

Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices

     Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised
warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the
Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19
to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the
market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower
on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17
lower at $65.00-$100.00.
     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted
high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven
days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.
     Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled
prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent
electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired
generation to meet increased weather-related demand.
     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average
of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British
thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average
of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.
     ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got
people coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are much
more realistic prices.""
     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the
outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for
delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00
yesterday.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged
with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission
capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in
southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.
     ""What's happening is the people who don't have firm
transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those
high prices since they have no choice,"" one MAPP trader said.
     ""Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a
firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices
fell off,"" he said, ""and bought from them at those lower prices,
causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade.""

Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast

     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast
U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was
forecast for the region this week, traders said.
     Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since
many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures
climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.
     ""There was nothing going on in Florida today,"" said one
southern energy trader. ""Everything was going to markets in the
north.""
     Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into
markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority
grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.
     ""Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as
forecasts came out,"" said on Entergy power trader. ""Prices,
declined to $60 and less.""
     The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95
to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades
were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent
estimates.
     Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather
forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week
caused prices to decline in the region.
     In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was
the main culprit behind lower prices.
     ""The cold weather's backing off,"" said one SPP utility
trader. ""It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and
today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was
bitter cold and today it was just plain cold.""
     Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though
the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern
SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.

U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand

     London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in
the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to
increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.
     The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the
Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01
pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees
to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services
Corp. in the U.S.
     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15
pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.
     December continued to fall amid a combination of position
closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will
not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.
     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.
     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with
expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue
to stifle demand, traders said.
     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a
megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.
     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.
     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer
2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.
Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a
megawatt-hour.
     Open positions on many short-term structures will likely
force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-
up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will
probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more
easily be assessed.

Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast

     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices
on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today
as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.
     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-
hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076
megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446
megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after
forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for
next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent
reservoirs from overflowing.
     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise
with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for
space heating.
     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active
trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders
said.
     ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" a
Stockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have been
selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should
now see a noticeable increase in the spot price.""
     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall
below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited
chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather
Services Corp. in the U.S.
     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was
expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict
temperatures to begin falling.
     Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22
percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell
4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.
     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise
by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.
     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-
term contracts.
     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,
1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a
megawatt-hour.
     Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although
expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers
to meet the increased demand, other traders said.
     Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,
will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.
     Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used
today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  A single buyer entered the 
marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices 
($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the 
time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 
cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to 
report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of 
line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Phillip

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.

667,"Phillip -- Is the value axis on Sheet 2 of the ""socalprices"" spread sheet 
supposed to be in $?  If so, are they the right values (millions?) and where 
did they come from?  I can't relate them to the Sheet 1 spread sheet.

As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our 
comments today along with a cover letter.  We have to fully understand the 
charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today.  It's much 
better to file an out-of-time supplement to timely comments than to file the 
whole thing late, particuarly since this is apparently on such a fast track.

Thanks.

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

   

 Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any 
questions.

 With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial

commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
others in that category at year end.  

 Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.  
Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.

 Let me know if there are any issues.

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

Today: Lost in the cosmos of Net-radio stations? Sorry, this site
will probably only add to the confusion. FMcities houses over 1,350
stations in North America, organized by city. Sound daunting? It
is... but here's the good part - every site listed here is 100-

 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the ""Checkbook"" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

 I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think 
I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.

 I will respond to the offer on Monday.  There is a $35 Million expansion 
adding 250 jobs in Burnet.  I am tempted to hold for $3000/acre.  Owner

I was glad to hear from you.  I hope we can put the past behind us.  Sounds 
like you have been busy.  Congratulations on the new baby.  Judging from your 
email all is well with you.   That's great.  

We did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace).  Three is it for us.  
What's your target?  The other two are doing well.  Soccer, T-ball, and bike 
riding keeps them busy.  They could use some of Cole's coordination.

My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now.  I am just on 
maintenance.  You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical 
cyclist.  We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months.  
He never misses, rain or shine.  Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial 
Park on Saturdays.   Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the 
road.  I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday.

I would like to hear more about your new job.  Maybe we could grab lunch 
sometime.  

Phillip

If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.  I can spread it over 6 
or 12 months.  6 month payout would be $190/month.  
12 month payout would be $95/month.  Your choice.  I would like it if you 
could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so.  Does $10/hr sound 
fair?  We can apply it to the loan.

Why am I not surprised ?

I suspect that if someone were to build a town called Lime, make
everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have
some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when
they're dead, 'Arry would move to that town in a flash and think
that he had arrived in Paradise on Earth.

According to my v-a-a-a-ast network of spies, sneaks and sleuths,
this next issue of The Last Straw focusses on lime... and to no one's
surprise, will feature some of the musings/wisdom/experience of our
Master of Lime, 'Arry .

Those same spies/sneaks/sleuths tell me that the format of this
next issue is a departure from the norm and may be a Beeg Surprise
to some.

Me ?  My curiosity is piqued and am itchin' to see this Limey
issue of The Last Straw and if you are afflicted with the same and
do not yet subscribe, it may not be too late:

I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and
development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I
think will be interesting to the group.

I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00  -   a
very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime
and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book
covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.

I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -
interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years
learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,
structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have
lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good
background information for sustainable builder folks.

Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.

The two analysts that I have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal 
Apte.
Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.
Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for 
the first 9 months.
I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent 
category.  I just don't want Vishal 
to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year.

Call me with questions.(x37041)

Western Power Spot Prices Sink Amid Weather-Related Demand

     Los Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.
spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply
outstripped demand.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-
hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.
     ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing
prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach
75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank
$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as
traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.
     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt
Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a
Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling
demand 84 percent below normal.
     ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is
causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at
$175.00-$228.00.
     According the California Independent System Operator today's
forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743
megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.

Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand

     Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in
available generation coupled with less weather-related demand,
caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much
as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from
Friday.
     ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based
trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for
heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week
long.""
     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000
megawatts through Friday.
     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for
the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to
service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to
hit the grid tomorrow.
     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2
nuclear power facilities.
     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1
at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of
a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at
full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned
and operated by Niagara Mohawk.
     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to
$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to
$51.25 and $40.00 indices.

Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak
power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high
weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,
traders said.
     ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee
Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy
to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.
""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of
that.""
     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday
into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose
$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25
when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.
     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00
and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the
Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.
     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at
$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.
     ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of
the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not
so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an
ECAR trader said.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from
the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,
though traders said transmission problems limited volume.
     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the
Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,
and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with
trades from $32.00-$40.00.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also
climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as
above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems
isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.
     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern
MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern
half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in
Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.
     ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems
getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said.
""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and
down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool).""

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up

     Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to
major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5
degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is
expected to begin Wednesday.
     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,
temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,
propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.
      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from
equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.
Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an
average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid
trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.
     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm
energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders
complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.
     ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the
supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader.
""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree
(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is
85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.""
     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for
tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done
at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders
said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South
starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at
$35-$36.
     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy
at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because
power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.
     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg
index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.
     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the
balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later
trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy
power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders
said.
     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was
bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for
the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades
were noted.

U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids

     London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling
interest, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a
megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before
closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than
Friday.
     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of
the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one
trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was
short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition
from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting
price levels, traders said.
     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was
expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production
costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after
last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas
futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15
pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since
the start of last week.
     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental
reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the
market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.
Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,
they said.

Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest

     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed
to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid
limited hydro-supply, traders said.
     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all
time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00
megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-
214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now
you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-
based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of the
snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are
steadily climbing.''
     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent
above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.
Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""more
realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet
outlooks.''
     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations
of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,
down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was
a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year.
     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour
with 140 megawatts exchanged.
     Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours
generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.

Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and 
jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include 
some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is 
working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA 
financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to 
you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still 
attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.

Subject: Talking points about California Gas market

Christy,

 I read these points and they definitely need some touch up.  I don't 
understand why we need to give our commentary on  why prices are so high in 
California.  This subject has already gotten so much press.

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our 
Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its 
forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been 
lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the 
second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The 
outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some 
additional insight?

Thank you,

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general 
contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from 
the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within 
his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe 
he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from 
the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you 
please email them to me as well?

Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current 
summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 
existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above 
assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email 
with comments.

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 
41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story 
porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the 
front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The 
living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the

and fax you a copy.

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially 
set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever 
the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very 
short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not 
match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic 
about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels 
into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on 
Friday, April 13th.  However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned 
I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get 
back in touch with you once he is finished.

Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager 
from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable 
with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp 
Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid 
for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am 
still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local 
relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final 
determination on unit mix and site plan.

The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit ""B"" are as follows:

Kohutek- $2,150 

Cuatro- $37,800


George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this 
amount.

The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500

I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.

Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?

What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 
221(d) loans?  

Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market 
quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:

  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment
  2%- overhead
  4%- profit

I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an 
extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even 
reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only 
generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about 
such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down 
to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?

I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you 
local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of 
the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.

Phillip

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a 
list of questions on the specs:

1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less 
and cost about the same?

2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory 
joist?

3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?

4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What 
type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or 
Cellulose?

5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?

6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know 
the difference between an apron and a stool.

7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent 
cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?

8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial 
one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.

9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under 
the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.

10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount 
stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.

11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.

12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?

13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?

14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron 
railings?

15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except 
for change orders?

I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but 
this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to 
call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the 
engineer.
I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership.  

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

Let me know what you think.

Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:

Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf 
(rentable)

What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?

Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2% 
overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.

Why is profit only 4%? 

Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.

What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to 
boost loan amount but not a real cost?

Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who 
receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?

Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?

What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts 
NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% 
expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage 
would only be 1.16.

Talk to you this afternoon.

Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of 
course).  He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period.  His existing

 Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.

 Specific features include:

 Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs
 Wood stairs
 Two story porches on front and rear
 Granite counters in kitchens and baths
 Tile floors in upstairs baths
 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths
 Solid wood interior doors
 Windows fully trimmed
 Crown molding in downstairs living areas
 2x6 wall on west side

 Undecided items include:

 Vinyl or Aluminum windows
 Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room
 Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 
sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a 
box with a simple roof 
 line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to 
replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than 
the full replatting process of 3 weeks?

Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the 
plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes 
across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for 
the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.

The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might 
object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the 
construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs 
of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the 
loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of 
equity that would be required. 

Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.

Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, 
engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are 
in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking 
directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on 
what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  

The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we 
need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and 
give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.

if we want to try and complete the project in phases.  Does he need to change 
what he is going to submit to the city.

I spoke to Gordon Kohutek this morning.  He was contracted to complete the 
soils study.  He says he will be done with his report by the end of the 
week.  I don't know who needs this report.  I told Gordon you might call to

		 Subject: Denver trading

I would like to welcome Susan Scott to the West Desk and specifically to the 
Eastern Rockies trading region.  The plan is for Susan to work with me in 
moving the day trading activities from the Denver office to Houston.  Her 
specific goals will be to take over activities performed by Nicole and 
Theresa while generating EOL products with me and in my absence.

Susan is currently learning how to use EOL and Sitara.  She is also working 
on understanding the grid and the relationship between all the different 
trading points from Opal to the mid-continent.

My plan is to have Susan go to the Denver office during May bid-week (April 
22 - April 24).  I want her to be sitting with Nicole and Theresa during 
bid-week to see and learn everything they do during that time.  I will 
probably want Nicole and Theresa to come to Houston one more time to sit with 
us and the logistics team, maybe in early May.  Then, Susan and I will both 
go to Denver in late May or early June to meet industry people and to 
complete the transfer of operations to the Houston office.

We can finalize these plans early next week and make all the corresponding 
reservations.

Thank you,

I realize you are disappointed about the project.  It is not my desire for 
you to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your list 
that I need further

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.
